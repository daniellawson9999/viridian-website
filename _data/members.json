As a high schooler, I hope to continue my robotics career by programming our robot. I hope to major in robotics and CS in college, and continue using robotics in the future. Outside of robotics, I love tennis, saxophone, volleyball, and science. As a programmer, I enjoy solving problems and finding creative solutions. As a second-year team member, I hope to learn more and contribute more to our team.",

I have learned 3D design through robotics and have enjoyed every moment of it (along with spending long nights in the robotics room getting everything ready for tournaments). It has been a lot of fun spending time with the team and crafting new robots to encompass our ideas.",

I’ve been interested since I was a freshman, but did not have the time to participate until my junior year as I was busy with work and fall sports. I had no prior experience with FTC but had spent time using low voltage electronics and programming them with Arduino. As such, it was easy for me to jump into the swing of FTC. This season, I spent most of my time working on our robot’s ability to hang, including some blacksmithing work to forge a suitable hook that will outlast 3D printed alternatives. ",
