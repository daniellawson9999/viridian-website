   asdfMy name is Luke and I am a sophomore here at Greenhill School. I am a very versatile member of the team. While I have programming experience, I also have building experience. I joined robotics because I see computer science as an important field now and in the coming decades. I hope to get experience with the hardware and software to put my computer science skills into action.
